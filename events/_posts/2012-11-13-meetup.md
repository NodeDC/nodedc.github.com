It's been too long everyone, time to find out what Nodawesomeness (tm) has been going on in the metro DC area!

What have you been up to and do you care to share :)? And what are folks interested in hearing about? Suggest ideas on the [meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/events/89233812/) or tweet 'em at us at [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc)!

FYI, We are thinking of mixing up the format a bit so we are looking for a mix of longer (15-30 minutes) and shorter presentations (5-10 minutes). We are going to try adding an Q&A after each presentation as well so you can ask while the ideas are hot :).

More to comeâ€¦
