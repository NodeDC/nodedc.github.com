The January NodeDC meetup will be on **Monday, January 16** at [Stetson's Bar and Grill]() at the intersection of 16th and U streets. These monthly events bring together developers to talk about node.js and are a great opportunity to share what you are working on, find out how others are using node, and get to know other local developers. This meetup will start at 7:00 pm, with a round of five minute lightning talks kicking off at 7:30 pm following introductions. 

This month we'll have four talks:
- [Aaron Silverman](https://twitter.com/#!/Zugwalt) will walk through "JavaScript: The Good Parts". 
- [Jonathan Altman](https://twitter.com/#!/async_io) will talk about generating heat maps of user click activity using node.js.
- [Dane Springmeyer](http://twitter.com/springmeyer) will talk about the state of node on Windows.
- [Luc Castera](https://twitter.com/#!/luccastera) will talk about the [Mongoose Nested Set](https://github.com/groupdock/mongoose-nested-set). 

If you'd like to give a talk at a future meetup, please send your topic to [@nodedc](https://twitter.com/#!/nodedc) or talk with one of the organizers at the event.
