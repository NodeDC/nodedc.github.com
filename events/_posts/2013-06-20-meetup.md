Thanks to Jen and Matthew for two excellent talks, and our hosts at Learning Objects. Our next meetup will be on July 18th, and will be a hands-on workshop to build a Node app from scratch. We're looking for volunteers to lead a table. If you're interested, please email your organizers Ed and Jonathan through the [Meetup Page](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/)
