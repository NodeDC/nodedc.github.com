The March NodeDC meetup will be **Monday, March 19 at 7:00 pm at Stetson's** right off 16th and U Streets NW. These meetups bring together people using and interested in node.js to talk, share what their working on, and get to know one another. 

So far we have two talks on the lineup:

- [Tom MacWright](https://twitter.com/#!/tmcw) will present on big data processing and visualization with node - solving the problem of analyzing road density data with [redis](http://redis.io/), [d3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/), [sqlite](http://www.sqlite.org/), [polymaps](http://polymaps.org/).

- [Kyle Hill](https://twitter.com/#!/kylehill) will talk about visualizing [Capital Bikeshare](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) data as a scoreboard for fastest point-to-point trips using the Persevere API.

The meetup will start at 7:00 pm, with a round of introductions and talks kicking off at 7:30 pm. Everyone is welcome. Stetson's is a bar - if you're not 21, message us at [@nodedc](https://twitter.com/#!/nodedc) and we'll try to get you in.
