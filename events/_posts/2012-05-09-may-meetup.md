The May NodeDC meetup will be **Wednesday, May 16 at 7:00 pm** at Stetson's Bar and Grill, near the intersection of 16th and U streets NW. This is a great opportunity to learn more about node.js, hear how people are using it, and get to know other local developers using and considering node.js. 

Once everyone has drinks at 7:30 pm, we'll do a round of introductions and then have several lightning talks. So far we have one on the lineup:

- [John Kelvie](http://twitter.com/johnkelvie) and Michael Myers of Atomizer Software will present the technical design of a game they are building with node.js, and request feedback. 

- [David Rees](https://twitter.com/#!/studgeek) will overview the key concepts and features of two of the newest Node.js web development frameworks - [Derby.](http://derbyjs.com/) and [Meteor](http://meteor.com/). Both combine realtime data propagation with live HTML generation on both the client and the server.

We meet once a month, usually the third Wednesday of the month. For updates, watch us here on github, follow [@nodedc](https://twitter.com/#!/nodedc) on Twitter, and join the [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/).
