Come on over to Development Seed's garage to talk about Node.js and why you should be using it on Tuesday, September 20. The July meetup brought out a lot of node.js developers and interested people, and we're hoping this one does the same.

We'll have a few five minute lightning talks around topics relating to Node.js. We're looking for a few more speakers. If you'd like to give one, please submit it here or send it to @developmentseed. So far, we have one lightning talk on the schedule.

Adrian Rossouw will give an intro to [Underscore.js](http://github.com/documentcloud/underscore.js). He'll run through some of the features of the most depended on package in npm. Underscore.js is quickly becoming a requirement for both server-side and client side developers, and its collection of small utility functions will help you work more efficiently with data structures. Underscore.js also forms the basis or inspiration for several other popular libraries, such as Backbone and Spine. More details on underscore.js are here.

Jeff Miccolis will present on the [couch-sqlite](https://github.com/developmentseed/couch-sqlite)
library for Node.js, which allows a SQLite database to subscribe to changes from CouchDB.
For example, this allows you to get real-time updates from Couch into a geo-enabled SQLite database.

Come on over around 7:00 pm. We'll do introductions and start the lightning talks at
7:30 pm. Bring some beer/drinks to share with the group - we'll provide the fridge and some snacks. Hope to see you there!

Development Seed's office is at 1714 14th Street NW, off the alley behind 14th Street (behind Peregrine and Cork). Turn down R street and make the first turn down the alley - you'll see our sign.
