The December NodeDC meetup will be on **Wednesday, December 14 at 7:00 pm**. We'll kick things off at 7:30 pm with introductions, followed by five minute lightning talks on topics related to node.js. So far, we have these talks lined up:

- [Ian Ward](http://twitter.com/ianshward) will talk about how deploying node apps, covering components like SSL, Upstart, Nginx, logging, and monitoring - a two hour talk in five exciting minutes.

- [Will White](https://twitter.com/#!/willwhitedc) will talk about node-inspector, a handy browser-based node debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints, step though code, and even edit code while a process is running.

- [Ray Daly](https://twitter.com/#!/raydaly) will talk about concept of TTD for APIs using node and hopes to get feedback from the group.

If youâ€™d like to give a lightning talk, send your topic to @nodedc.

The meetup will be at the upstairs bar of [Stetson's](http://stetsons-dc.com/), located right at 16th and U streets NW. Both the Dupont Circle metro stop on the red line and U street on the green line are about four blocks away, with 16th street buses all passing within a block of the bar.

Hope to see you there!
