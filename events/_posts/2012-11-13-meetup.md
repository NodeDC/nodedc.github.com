It's time again to find out about the Nodawesomeness (tm :) that has been going on in the metro DC area! We have four cool speakers lined up (but are always interested in more - see below).   

- [Social Tables](http://socialtables.com) will share how they are using Rails and Node.js together to power one of DC's newest startup [success stories](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/the-download-social-tables-raises-500k-plans-to-hire/2012/07/20/gJQAKHR52W_story.html). 
- Ryan Roemer ([@ryan_roemer](https://twitter.com/ryan_roemer)) will be giving us the down low on how [SpanishDict](http://www.spanishdict.com/) is using RequireJS/AMD to leverage JavaScript consistently across the server/client boundry.
- Andrew Brampton ([@TheBramp](https://twitter.com/TheBramp), [blog](http://bramp.net/blog/)) will talk about bringing Node.js into the real world through a Node.js extension for the Wii Remote.
- Valentina Alekhina ([@Valentina9](http://twitter.com/Valentina9)) will share some of team sn00zy's plans to triumph at [Node Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com/) using Node.js and PhoneGap.

And... What have you been up to and do you care to share? Let us know on the [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/events/89233812/) or at [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc)! We are looking for both short (5-10 minutes) and longer (15-30 minutes) presentations.

PS, For updates on future events join the [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/), watch us on [GitHub](http://nodedc.github.com/), and/or follow us at [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc).
