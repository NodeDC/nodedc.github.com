The February NodeDC meetup will be on **Monday, February 20 starting at 7:00 pm** at [Stetson's Bar and Grill](http://nodedc.github.com/) at the intersection of 16th and U streets. So far we have one speaker:

- [Jafar Amjad](https://twitter.com/#!/jafaramjad) will present on making a Node.js multiplayer site, specifically one that uses a low amount of bandwidth per player and features lasers, gravity, and walk cycles via animated gif's. Check out his [early beta version](http://jaf.ar.com) for a preview. 

- [Ryan Roemer](https://twitter.com/#!/ryan_roemer) will talk about [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async).

We're looking for more volunteers to give 5 minute lightning talks on topics relating to [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). If you'd like to share a recent project you've built on node, code, or anything else, send a message to [@nodedc](https://twitter.com/#!/nodedc) and we'll add you to the lineup. 

The monthly NodeDC meetups bring together developers to talk about node.js and are a great opportunity to meet other developers, learn more about node, and see some examples of how people are using it. Everyone is welcome. Stetson's is a 21+ venue, but if you're underage and want to attend, reach out to [Bonnie](mailto:bonnie@mapbox.com) and she'll try to get you in. 

NodeDC meets once a month, usually on the third Monday of the month. For updates watch us here on github, follow [@nodedc](https://twitter.com/#!/nodedc), and join the [meetup.com group](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/). Hope to see you there!
