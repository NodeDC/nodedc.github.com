It's time again to find out about the Nodawesomeness (tm :) that has been going on in the metro DC area! We have four cool speakers lined up (but are always interested in more - see below).   

- [Social Tables](http://socialtables.com) will share how they are using Rails and Node.js together to power one of DC's newest startup [success stories](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/the-download-social-tables-raises-500k-plans-to-hire/2012/07/20/gJQAKHR52W_story.html). 
- [Ryan Roemer](https://twitter.com/ryan_roemer) will be giving us the down low on how [SpanishDict](http://www.spanishdict.com/) is using RequireJS/AMD to leverage JavaScript consistently across the server/client boundry.
- [Andrew Brampton](http://bramp.net/blog/2011/10/my-experiences-with-developing-multi-threaded-nodejs-extensions/) will talk about bringing Node.js into the real world through a Node.js extension for the Wii Remote.
- [Valentina Alekhina](http://twitter.com/Valentina9) will share some of team sn00zy's plans to triumph at [Node Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com/) using RPG, SVG, and PhoneGap.
- And... What have you been up to and do you care to share? letus know on the [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/events/89233812/) or tweet 'em at us at [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc)!

FYI, We are thinking of mixing up the format a bit so we are looking for a mix of longer (15-30 minutes) and shorter presentations (5-10 minutes). We are going to try adding an Q&A after each presentation as well so you can ask while they're hot :).
