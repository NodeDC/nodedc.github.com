The next [Washington, DC Node.js meetup](http://nodedc-november.eventbrite.com/) will be on **Monday, November 14 at 7:00 pm**. We'll be in a different venue this time, taking over the upstairs bar at [Stetson's](http://stetsons-dc.com/index.php), near the intersection of 16th and U Streets NW. We'll kick off the formal part of the meetup at 7:30 pm, starting with introductions and then diving into a series of five minute lightning talks on topics relating to node.js. If you'd like to get on the lineup, send your topic to [@nodedc](https://twitter.com/#!/nodedc) or speak up at the meetup.

So far we have these talks on the lineup:

- [Young Hahn](https://twitter.com/#!/younghahn) will talk about [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), pointing out useful things he's learned about the open source document-oriented database 
- [Chris Verwymeren](https://twitter.com/#!/cvee) will talk about running node.js apps in Ubuntu with [Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/).
- [Aaron Silverman](http://twitter.com/Zugwalt) and [Dylan Greene](https://twitter.com/#!/dylang) will talk about their [Node Knockout](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/9895206272/node-knockout-winners) project [DoodleOrDie](http://doodleordie.com/), which one "most fun" entry.
- [Justin Miller](https://twitter.com/#!/incanus77), visiting from Portland, will talk about how he bridged Cocoa to node.js

Everyone is welcome to attend this meetup, including newcomers to node.js, those interested to hear what the hype is about, and experienced developers looking to trade tricks. 

We hold a node.js meetup once a month, usually the third week of the month. Check here for details on past and future events, and follow [@nodedc](https://twitter.com/#!/nodedc) for updates.
