The third-ever Node.js meetup held in Washington, DC will be Wednesday, September 19. The meetup will start at 7:00 pm, with talks starting at 7:30 so everyone has a chance to grab a drink and talk to folks. Then we'll have introductions, followed by 5 minute lightning talks on anything related to node. We're looking for volunteers to present - if you'd like to give a talk, submit an idea on the lanyard event page or tweet it at @developmentseed. So far, we have one on the lineup:

- Will White will talk about testing node.js web applications with [expresso, an async testing framework](https://github.com/visionmedia/expresso).
- Ryan Roemer will talk about Sunny.js, a multi-cloud datastore client for Node.js with read/write streams and async.js.

Everyone is welcome - including newcomers to node.js, those interested to hear what the hype is about, and experienced developers looking to trade tricks.

The meetup will be in Development Seed's garage is at 1714 14th Street NW, off the alley behind 14th Street (behind Peregrine and Cork). Turn down R street and make the first turn down the alley - you'll see our sign.

Bring some beer/drinks to share with the group. Hope to see you there!
