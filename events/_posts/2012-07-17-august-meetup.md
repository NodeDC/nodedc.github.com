Given chaotic summer schedules, we're combining July and August meetups together and will meet on **Wednesday, August 15 at 7:00 pm** at Stetson's to talk about all things related to node.js. Whether you're an experienced node.js developer, interested in diving in, or just want to learn more about it, come on out to meet local folks using node and hear some lightning talks about what they're doing with it. 

We are looking for people to give five minute lightning talks on topics related to node - projects built on it, coding and performance tricks, and anything that could be of interest. If you'd like to give a talk, send a message to [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc) on Twitter or [through meetup](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/) and weâ€™ll add you to the lineup.

NodeDC usually meets once a month, on the second Wednesday of the month. For updates, watch us on [github](http://nodedc.github.com/), follow [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc) on Twitter, and join [our meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/).
