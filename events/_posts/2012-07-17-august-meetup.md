Given chaotic summer schedules, we're combining the July and August meetups together and will meet on **Wednesday, August 15 at 7:00 pm** at Stetson's to talk about all things related to node.js. Whether you're an experienced Node.js developer, interested in diving in, or just want to learn more about it, come on out to meet local folks using node and hear some lightning talks about what they're doing with it.

Presentations summary:

- [Jonathan Altman](http://twitter.com/async_io) will give an overview on [Everyauth](http://everyauth.com) and its mongodb/mongoose extension [mongoose-auth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth). A simple Express starter app built with node, express, twitter bootstrap, Mongoose, and mongoose-auth is available on [github](https://github.com/jonathana/expspreleton)

- [Dan MacTough](https://twitter.com/danmactough) will give an overview on his Node.js work-in-progress, [SubSub](http://subsub.org). SubSub is a feed subscription hub where you can manage your RSS/Atom subscriptions and create ["news rivers"](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews) for reading and sharing.

- [Ryan Roemer](@ryan_roemer) will give a talk on [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), a lightweight, Ruby/Python-inspired language that compiles into JavaScript. He has posted his [slides](http://ryan-roemer.github.com/nodedc-coffeescript-talk/) and has also done a summary [blog post](http://loose-bits.com/2012/08/16/five-things-i-like-about-coffeescript.html).

- [Luke Berndt](https://twitter.com/LukeBerndt) will present on his Node.js DC restaurant inspection scraper/mapper.

NodeDC usually meets once a month, on the third Wednesday of the month. For updates, watch us on [github](http://nodedc.github.com/), follow [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc) on Twitter, and join [our meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/).

We are looking for people to give five minute lightning talks on topics related to node - projects built on it, coding and performance tricks, and anything that could be of interest. If you'd like to give a talk, send a message to [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc) on Twitter or [through meetup](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/) and weâ€™ll add you to the lineup!
