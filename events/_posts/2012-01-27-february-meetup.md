This month we're joining forces with the folks from [DC jQuery](http://www.meetup.com/DC-jQuery-Users-Group/) for a joint meetup on **Monday, February 20 starting at 7:00 pm**. This month we'll be at **Fathom Creative** at 1333 14th Street NW (at Rhode Island). We have three speakers on the lineup so far.

- [Jafar Amjad](https://twitter.com/#!/jafaramjad) will present on making a Node.js multiplayer site, specifically one that uses a low amount of bandwidth per player and features lasers, gravity, and walk cycles via animated gif's. Check out his [early beta version](http://jaf.ar.com) for a preview. 

- [Ryan Roemer](https://twitter.com/#!/ryan_roemer) will talk about [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async).

- [Dylan Greene](https://twitter.com/#!/dylang) will present HTML Canvas while giving a jaw-dropping [DoodleOrDie](http://doodleordie.com/) demo.

The monthly NodeDC meetups bring together developers to talk about node.js and are a great opportunity to meet other developers, learn more about node, and see some examples of how people are using it. Everyone is welcome. NodeDC meets once a month, usually on the third Monday of the month. For updates watch us here on github, follow [@nodedc](https://twitter.com/#!/nodedc), and join the [meetup.com group](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/). Hope to see you there!
