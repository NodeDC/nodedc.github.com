The January NodeDC meetup will be on **Monday, January 16** at [Stetson's Bar and Grill]() at the intersection of 16th and U streets. These monthly events bring together developers to talk about node.js and are a great opportunity to share what you are working on, find out how others are using node, and get to know other local developers. This meetup will start at 7:00 pm, with a round of five minute lightning talks kicking off at 7:30 pm following introductions. So far we have three talks on the lineup:

- [Aaron Silverman](zugwalt) will walk through "JavaScript: The Good Parts". 
- [Jonathan Altman](https://twitter.com/#!/async_io) will talk about generating heat maps of user click activity using node.js.
- Someone from [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/) will talk about Mongo vs. Couch.

If you'd like to give a talk, please send your topic to [@nodedc](https://twitter.com/#!/nodedc) and we'll add you to the list.
