Thanks for a great meetup presenters and attendees! We had lots of good discussion. As we get them we will put any slides/links from the presenters below.

In the meantime, if you have ideas for February let us know! What have you been up to or what would you like to hear about? Let us know in this [meetup discussion](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/messages/boards/thread/28756532) or at [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc)! We are looking for both short (5-10 minutes) and longer (15-30 minutes) presentations.
