2013 is upon us and its time to plan our next NodeDC meetup!

We are still working on a date, but in the meantime we are looking for topics.

What have you been up to or what would you like to hear about? Let us know on the [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/events/98796672/) or at [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc)! We are looking for both short (5-10 minutes) and longer (15-30 minutes) presentations.

PS, For updates on future events join the [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/), watch us on [GitHub](http://nodedc.github.com/), and/or follow us at [@NodeDC](http://twitter.com/nodedc).
