The April NodeDC meetup will be **Wednesday, April 25** at 7:00 pm at Stetson's Bar right at 16th and U Streets NW. Come out to meet [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) developers, see how people are using node and what they're building, and share your own experiences with it. No node.js experience is needed - just come out ready to talk to people and ask questions. 

At 7:30, we'll have a round of introductions followed by several five minute lightning talks. So far, we have one on the lineup:

- [Aaron Silverman](http://twitter.com/Zugwalt) will talk about his experiences with free sandbox node.js hosting using [nodester](http://nodester.com/) or [nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com/) for those looking to play around.

- [Dane Springmeyer](https://twitter.com/#!/springmeyer) will give an introduction to message passing in node.js, To scale programs across many cores and machines efficient message passing is critical. Dane will review the tools you have to work with in node, covering the 'child_process' module, the new 'cluster' module, and third-party add on's like zeromq.node.

If you'd like to give a talk on something related to node - whether it's code, a project, or an idea - send a message to [@nodedc](http://twitter.com/nodedc) or through the meetup group and we'll add you to the lineup.

This meetup group meets once a month, usually on the fourth Wednesday of the month. For updates, watch us here, follow [@nodedc](http://twitter.com/nodedc) on Twitter, and [join the meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/).
